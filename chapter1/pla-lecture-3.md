## Isomers



Isomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula.  There are several different types of isomers, for now, we will consider two types: constitutional and geometric.

## Constitutional Isomers

Constitutional isomers are compounds that differ in their connectivity.  Of course, as isomers, they have the same number and type of atoms, but the atoms are arranged differently.  Take a look at the video to the right to see examples and how to approach drawing isomers systematically.
