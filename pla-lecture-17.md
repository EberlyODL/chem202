# Organic Reaction Overview

## Nucleophiles and Electrophiles

All of the reactions we will study this semester will be between nucleophiles and electrophiles.  If you can determine which atom is the nucleophile and where the electrophilic site is, you will be able to predict any reaction we throw at you!

Recall your definitions - a nucleophile (Lewis base) is an electron-rich atom capable of donating a pair of electrons.  An electrophile (Lewis acid) is an electron-deficient atom that is capable of accepting an electron pair.  Some common nucleophiles and electrophiles are shown in Figure 1.

You have already seen examples in the acid base unit (see Figure 2).  Notice how the curved arrows indicate the movement of electrons.  You will always start from a lone pair or a bond and move toward the electrophile.

# Reaction Mechanisms

Reaction mechanisms are used to show how electrons are rearranging in a chemical process.  Understanding mechanism is powerful because it allows you to predict products of any organic reaction.  Mechanisms the best guess as to what is happening at the molecular level and are supported by experimental data.

We will be using three basic mechanistic patterns (we will add 1-2 more as we move through the course). 

The first pattern we have seen before.  This is known as a **proton transfer**.  A proton ($$H^+$$) is transferred from one molecule to another and is illustrated by two curved arrows.
