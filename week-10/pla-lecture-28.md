# Nomenclature of carboxylic acids and derivatives

We're going to dive a bit deeper (but not too deep) into the reactions of carboxylic acids and derivatives this week.  We'll be looking a structures, so of course it will be nice to know the language.  There is a nice overview of the nomenclature of the 5 functional groups in the video below.  If you find you want more details, feel free to check out the specific functional group videos farther down the page.

Here's how the derivatives fit into our nomenclature hierarchy.

| Group (Highest-->lowest) | Suffix | As substituent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -COOH, acid | -oic acid | n/a for us |
| -COOCl, acid chloride | -oyl chloride | n/a for us |
| -COOR, ester | -oate | n/a for us |
| -COONR$$_2$$, amide | -amide | n/a for us |
| -OH, alcohol | -ol | -hydroxy- |
| -SH, thiol | -thiol | -mercapto- |
| -NH$$_2$$, amine | -amine | -amino- |
| C=C, alkene | -ene | n/a |
| C$$\equiv$$C, alkyne | -yne | n/a |
