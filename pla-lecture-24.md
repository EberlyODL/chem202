# Naming ethers and sulfides

We will be synthesizing new functional groups with substitution reactions in the first two class sessions this week.

The prelecture content will focus on naming these functional groups so you know the language to speak fluently throughout the rest of the course.  We'll also be incorporating some review of reactions and mechanism to keep it fresh in your mind. If you struggle with this portion, please reach out!

Ethers and sulfides are named two different ways.  One is according to a common nomenclature system and the other, the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system.  Both systems are used, so we will cover the basics of both.

Ethers contain a C-O-C arrangement while sulfides are the sulfur analogs with a C-S-C arrangement.  The common system is quite simple.  Name the two alkyl groups on either side followed by the name "ether" or "sulfide."  The alkyl groups are listed alphabetically.  In the case where the two alkyl groups are identical, the prefix "di-" is used in front of the alky groups.  Examples are shown below:
