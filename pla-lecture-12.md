# Representing Cyclohexane

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Draw the two different chair conformations of cyclohexane

* Identify axial and equitorial bonds


So far, we have drawn cyclohexane as a polygon in two dimensions.  Now, we are going to explore its three-dimensional structure.

The most stable conformation of a cyclohexane ring is known as a "chair" conformation.  It gets its name because it resembles a lounge chair.  You are encouraged to build a model like that in Figure 2 so you can see it for yourself.

In the video below, you are talked through the procedure for drawing two different chair conformations and defining axial and equitorial bonds.
