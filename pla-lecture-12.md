# Representing Cyclohexane

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Draw the two different chair conformations of cyclohexane

* Identify axial and equitorial bonds


So far, we have drawn cyclohexane as a polygon in two dimensions.  Now, we are going to explore its three-dimensional structure.

The most stable conformation of a cyclohexane ring is known as a "chair" conformation (Figure 1).  It gets its name because it resembles a lounge chair (Figure 2).  You are encouraged to build a model like that in Figure 3 so you can see it for yourself.

In the video below, you are talked through the procedure for drawing the two different chair conformations and axial and equitorial bonds are defined.  Get out your pencil and paper and practice drawing these figures! :)
