# Hemiacetals

As we wrap up Chapter 12, we are going to look at alcohols as nucleophiles in carbonyl addition reactions.  

Aldehydes (or ketones) in water will be in equilibrium with their hydrate form.  

Similarly, when alcohols are the solvent, a hemiacetal and acetal form exist.  A hemiacetal is when one group is an OR and the other is an OH.  An acetal is when both are OR groups.
