# Identifying Chiral Centers

Many organic molecules are chiral. If a compound is chiral, this means that it cannot be superimposed with its mirror image. The examples on this slide show amino acids that have been reflected across the line drawn down the center of the slide. It’s probably easiest to notice this by looking at the three-dimensional structure on bottom, but the two mirror images are distinct shapes, and it’s impossible to rotate or translate the molecule on the left in order to make it look like the molecule on the right. This property is similar to the differences that exist between your hands. Although your two hands look similar, they are in fact mirror images of each other and have their own distinct shapes. 

The two mirror images, also known as enantiomers, are each given labels. The molecules on the left side of the slide are the “L” enantiomers and the molecules on the right side of the slide are the “D” enantiomers. These names come from the latin prefixes “levo” and “dextro,” which mean “to the left” and “to the right,” respectively. For now it is not necessary for you to be able to label an amino acid as “L” or “D”. 

All of the amino acids found in proteins are L-amino acids. Although D-amino acids are sometimes found in nature, they are not used to make proteins. 

Chiral centers (also known as stereocenters) are carbons that are attached to four different substituents. Shown on the slide is some hypothetical molecule A, which is attached to four different atoms. When we reflect molecule A across the dotted line we produce its mirror image, molecule B. If we rotate molecule B by 180°, we see that it is not superimposable with molecule A (notice that the positions of the blue and green atoms are reversed). Molecule A is a chiral molecule because it can’t be superimposed with its mirror image.

When looking for chiral centers, look for tetrahedral carbon atoms that are attached to four different substituents. 

Let’s look at an example of a molecule that is not chiral. The hypothetical molecule C is shown here. It is attached to a red atom, a gray atom, and two green atoms; it is therefore attached to only three different substituents (two of the substituents are both green atoms). When we reflect molecule C across the dotted line we produce its mirror image, molecule D. If we rotate molecule D by 180°, we see that it is superimposable with molecule C (the two molecules are indistinguishable). Molecule C is not a chiral molecule because it can be superimposed with its mirror image.

Shown here is an example of a chiral molecule, 2-bromobutane. This molecule cannot be superimposed with its mirror image. 

Note that the chiral carbon is attached to four different substituents: a hydrogen atom, a bromine atom, a “$$CH_3$$” group, and a “$$CH_2CH_3$$ group. Even though the chiral carbon is attached to two carbons, these carbons are distinguishable from each other (“$$CH_3$$” is not the same as “$$CH_2CH_3$$”). 

The different mirror images of chiral molecules (called enantiomers) have distinct shapes, and its often the case that these differences lead to differences in function and even reactivity. Shown here is one example of this. The structure on the right is of a protein from the venom of the Malayan pit viper. This protein is an enzyme called an L-amino acid oxidase. It catalyzes the degradation of L-amino acids in order to produce hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme uses a molecule called FAD (derived from vitamin B2) as part of this reaction. The enzyme is specific for L-amino acids; it will not catalyze the degradation of D-amino acids. The structure shown here helps explain why the enzyme doesn’t work on D-amino acids. What is shown is the cavity inside the enzyme (shown as a surface representation) in which the reaction takes place; this location is known as the enzyme’s active site. The enzyme helps to accelerate this reaction in part by binding both FAD and the L-amino acid and holding them close to each other, increasing the likelihood that they will bump into one another and react. Notice the interactions that the enzyme forms with the amino acid (hydrogen bonds shown in yellow) in order to hold it in place. The enzyme forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic acid group of the amino acid (bottom left) as well as a hydrogen bond with the amine group of the amino acid (bottom center). Meanwhile, a large cavity in the enzyme provides space for the side chain (in this particular amino acid the side chain is an aromatic ring). When the enzyme interacts with the L-amino acid in this way, the alpha carbon becomes oriented directly towards the reactive part of the FAD molecule, priming the reaction to occur. Notice that a D-amino acid could not fit into the active side in the same way. If this were a D-amino acid, the amine group would point upwards and towards FAD, and in fact, a space-filling model would show that the amine group would overlap with FAD. In other words, a D-amino acid could not bind to this active site at the same time as FAD; they don’t fit. 

This phenomenon is similar to trying to putting your right foot into a left shoe. Both the your foot and the shoe are chiral, just like the amino acid and the active site of the enzyme, and unless the two shapes complement one another, they will not fit together.
