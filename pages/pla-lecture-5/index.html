<h1>Hybridization</h1>

<p>Hybridization is the idea that atomic orbitals (s and p) mix to form hybrid orbitals.  This theory <em>explains</em> some of the experimental measurements of bond lengths and angles in molecules.</p>

<p>The number of domains about an atom determines the type of orbitals used in forming sigma bonds or holding lone pairs (for a review of what constitutes a "domain," check out the foundations section on <a href="/vsepr-theory.md">electron domain geometry</a>).  </p>

<h2><lrn-math>sp^3</lrn-math> Hybridization</h2>

<p><lrn-math>sp^3</lrn-math> hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals.  Since four orbitals are mixed, you end up with four <lrn-math>sp^3</lrn-math> hybrid orbitals.  Most atoms with four domains will be <lrn-math>sp^3</lrn-math> hybridized.  (We will discuss exceptions when we look at resonance in more detail in a week or two.)</p>

<h2><lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> Hybridization</h2>

<p><lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals.  Since three orbitals are mixed, you end up with three <lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> hybrid orbitals. There will be an atomic p orbital that remains unhybridized.  This p orbital will be empty or involved in a pi bond. Most atoms with three domains will be <lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> hybridized.</p>
