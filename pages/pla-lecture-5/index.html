<h1>Hybridization</h1>
<p>Hybridization is the idea that atomic orbitals (s and p) mix to form hybrid orbitals.  This theory <em>explains</em>


 some of the experimental measurements of bond lengths and angles in molecules.</p>
<p>The number of domains about an atom determines the type of orbitals used in forming sigma bonds or holding lone pairs (for a review of what constitutes a "domain," check out the foundations section on <a href="/vsepr-theory.md">electron domain geometry</a>


).  </p>

 hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals.  Since four orbitals are mixed, you end up with four $$sp^3$$ hybrid orbitals.  Most atoms with four domains will be $$sp^3$$ hybridized.  (We will discuss exceptions when we look at resonance in more detail in a week or two.)</p>

<h2>$$sp^2$$ Hybridization</h2>
<p>$$sp^2$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals.  Since three orbitals are mixed, you end up with three $$sp^2$$ hybrid orbitals. There will be an atomic p orbital that remains unhybridized.  This p orbital will be empty or involved in a pi bond. Most atoms with three domains will be $$sp^2$$ hybridized.</p>
