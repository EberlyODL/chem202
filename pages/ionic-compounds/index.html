<h1>Ionic Bonding</h1>

<p>Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, thus ionic compounds always consist of positive and negative ions. Ionic compounds are almost always combinations of metals and nonmetals. An example is Sodium fluoride (NaF), a combination of a metal (sodium) and a nonmetal (fluorine) (from the left and right sides of the periodic table, respectively). Similarly, potassium sulfate (K$$<em>2$$SO$$</em>4$$) contains both a metal (potassium) and two nonmetals (sulfur and oxygen). Ammonium chloride (NH$$<em>4$$Cl), is one of the few exceptions to the “metal-nonmetal” trend. Ammonium chloride consists of the positive ammonium ion (NH$$</em>4^+$$) and the negative chloride ion (Cl$$^-$$), as such, this compound is an ionic compound even though it consists only of nonmetals. Ionic compounds tend to exist as extended networks of atoms (rather than as discrete molecules). These compounds form extended lattices (where the cation and anion repeat over and over again) and they tend to be brittle and have high melting points.</p>
