<h1>Organic Foundations</h1>

<p>There are 4 core content areas from general or introductory chemistry that are important foundations to determining the reactivity and properties of organic compounds.</p>

<p>1) Atomic Structure
    - Orbitals
    - Electron Configuration</p>

<p>2) Chemical Bonding
    - Intro to Bonding
    - Ionic Compounds
    - Covalent Compounds
    - Bond Polarity &amp; Electronegativity
    - Valence Bond Theory</p>

<p>3) Drawing Structures
    - Formal Charge
    - Lewis Structure
    - Exceptions to the octet rule
    - Resonance</p>

<p>4) Molecular Shape
    - VSEPR Theory
    - Molecular Geometry
    - Molecular polarity</p>

<p>There are links embedded throughout the review to the CHEM 110 ebook, so if you purchased that, you will be able to use those as a resource if you wish.  Any other Introductory or General Chemistry text can serve as a reference for this material if you do not have access.  Another good resource may be this free ebook <em><a href="https://bit.ly/prepbook">Preparation for Organic Chemistry</a></em> by David Reingold.</p>

<p>At the end of each content area, you will find a link back to canvas asking you to complete a problem set.  You can attempt this problem set as many times as you like.  Only the highest score will be recorded.  Your score on these 4 practice sets will account for 20 points of your Foundations score.  The remaining 20 points will come from a 30-minute quiz on January 22 in class.</p>
