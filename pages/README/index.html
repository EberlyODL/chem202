<h1>Organic Foundations</h1>
<p>There are 4 core content areas from general or introductory chemistry that are important foundations to determining the reactivity and properties of organic compounds.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Atomic Structure</p>
<ul>
<li>Orbitals</li>
<li>Electron Configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chemical Bonding</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro to Bonding</li>
<li>Ionic Compounds</li>
<li>Covalent Compounds</li>
<li>Bond Polarity &amp; Electronegativity</li>
<li>Valence Bond Theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing Structures</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal Charge</li>
<li>Lewis Structure</li>
<li>Exceptions to the octet rule</li>
<li>Resonance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molecular Shape</p>
<ul>
<li>VSEPR Theory</li>
<li>Molecular Geometry</li>
<li>Molecular polarity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are links embedded throughout the review to the CHEM 110 ebook, so if you purchased that, you will be able to use those as a resource if you wish.  Any other Introductory or General Chemistry text can serve as a reference for this material if you do not have access.  Another good resource may be this free ebook <em><a href="https://bit.ly/prepbook">Preparation for Organic Chemistry</a></em> by David Reingold.</p>
<p>At the end of each content area, you will find a link back to canvas asking you to complete a problem set.  You can attempt this problem set as many times as you like.  Only the highest score will be recorded.  Your score on these 4 practice sets will account for 20 points of your Foundations score.  The remaining 20 points will come from a 30-minute quiz on January 22 in class.</p>
