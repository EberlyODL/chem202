<h1>Molecular Geometry</h1>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <em>After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦</em>
* Apply the electron pair repulsion model (VSEPR) and use Lewis structures to determine the electron domain geometries and molecular geometries of atoms in a molecule.</p>

<p>The three important electron domain geometries give rise to five molecular geometries.  The molecular geometry describes the shape of the molecule considering only the bonded atoms.</p>

<p>A summary of the molecular geometries is shown below. (In this course, you only need to know the 5 molecular geometries coming from EDG of linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral.) The names describe the shapes, so focus on looking for the shape as described by the name.  This will help you recognize them!</p>
