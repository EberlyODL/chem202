<h1>Dehydration Review</h1>

<p>In the next class session, we will connect the mechanism of the dehydration reaction of alcohols to a reaction coordinate diagram and concepts relating to thermodynamics and kinetics.</p>

<p>Things to remember about mechanism:</p>

<ul><li><p>The slowest step will be "rate-determining" and usually produces the highest energy intermediate</p></li><li><p>A reaction will proceed faster if it goes through a lower energy intermediate</p></li><li><p>The number of steps in the mechanism translates to the number of transition states (bumps) on the curve in a reaction coordinate diagram.</p></li></ul>

<p>Refer to your notes from Monday&#39;s class session or  to section 9.4 in the textbook for details specific to the dehydration reaction.</p>

<p>The question set gets you thinking about predicting the products of dehydration reactions and thinking about the reaction mechanism.  </p>

<p>We will move into substitution of alcohols as well on Friday!  Read section 9.2 for a preview! :)</p>
