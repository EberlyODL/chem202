<h1>Alpha Hydrogens</h1>

<p>For compounds containing a carbonyl group, Greek letters are used to describe the proximity of each carbon atom to the carbonyl.  </p>

<p>The carbonyl itself does not receive a Greek letter.  In this example, there are two carbon atoms designated as alpha ($$\alpha$$) positions.  Hydrogen atoms are designated with the Greek letter of the carbon to which they are attached; for example, the hydrogen atoms (protons) connected to the $$\alpha$$ carbon atoms are called $$\alpha$$ protons.</p>

<p>The alpha ($$\alpha$$) hydrogens of carbonyl compounds are unusually acidic. Do you know why?  The pKa ranges from 16-20 for aldehydes and ketones and is a bit higher (24-ish) for esters.  (Compare this to pKa=60 for an ordinary $$sp^3$$ hybridized C-H bond.)</p>

<p>Well, acidity is related to the stability of an acid&#39;s conjugate base.  So, if we consider the conjugate base, maybe that will help.</p>

<p>You may notice that the conjugate base has a lone pair next to a pi bond, which is a <a href="/pla-lecture-4.md">pattern of resonance</a> you may recognize.  The presence of resonance makes this base more stable, and therefore, the C-H bond of an $$\alpha$$ carbon more acidic.  </p>

<p>Next, read through section 13.1 and try the problems within.  You want to be able to explain why $$\alpha$$-H&#39;s next to esters are less acidic than those next to aldehydes and ketones.</p>

<p>There are a couple questions to practice with in Canvas!</p>
