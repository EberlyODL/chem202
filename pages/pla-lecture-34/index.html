<h1>Oxidation of Alcohols and Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones</h1>

<p>Read Chapter 9.5 (all) and 12.7 (through problem 17).</p>

<p>Know the following reactions and be able to predict the products or reactants.  We will discuss the mechanism and related reactions and applications in class!  Have fun! :)</p>
