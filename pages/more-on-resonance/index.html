<h1>More on Resonance</h1>
<p>As we know, resonance is the delocalization of electrons. Specifically, the delocalization of pi electrons (more on that below).</p>
<p>In the foundations unit, we covered the definition of resonance (<a href="/resonance.md">foundations link here</a>). Then, we learned a few patterns to look for in organic structures to help us recognize that resonance is present in a molecule (<a href="/pla-lecture-4.md">Resonance PLA</a>).</p>
<p>Review those units linked above and practice with the problem sets before you continue below!</p>
<p>You should be able to draw resonance contributors for a variety of organic compounds. We will now see that resonance contributors are not all created equal.</p>

<p>When two or more resonance structures exist, then it is necessary to evaluate their relative contribution to the hybrid. When ranking resonance contributors, consider the following <strong>in order</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Is the octet is satisfied? This is the most important factor to stability and is more important than charge.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Is formal charge is minimized?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Electronegative atoms have negative charge and electropositive atoms have positive charge.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no way to differentiate the two structures, they are equivalent.</p>
<h2>Resonance is delocalized pi bonding</h2>
<p>Another way to describe resonance is as <em>delocalized pi bonding</em>. Only electrons in p orbitals can be delocalized in a pi system.</p>

<p>Let's use the amide functional group shown below as an example. The experimental H-N-H bond angle is observed to be 121.6 degrees. How do we explain this? What is the geometry? What is the hybridization of the nitrogen atom? This is an example of where we need to consider the available theories in order to explain the experimental observation.</p>
<p>According to VSEPR, we would predict a tetrahedral electron domain geometry and angles less than 109.5 degrees (much like ammonia, <lrn-math>NH_3</lrn-math>). This disagrees with our experiments!</p>
<p>What if we hybridize the orbitals? That nitrogen atom has 4 domains, so if we hybridize the 2s and three 2p orbitals, we get four equivalent <lrn-math>sp^3</lrn-math> hybrid orbitals. These will arrange themselves in a tetrahedral geometry to minimize electron-electron repulsion. That takes us back to the 109.5 degree bond angles...</p>
<p>Ugh, now what?! Go back to the data. The bond angles are about 120 degrees. This corresponds to a trigonal planar geometry which results from <lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> hybridization (mixing of the 2s and two 2p orbitals). Perhaps the nitrogen atom contributes <lrn-math>sp^2</lrn-math> orbitals to form its three bonds. What happened to the remaining p orbital that wasn't hybridized? It's still there! That orbital holds the lone pair.</p>
<p>So, why is this system an exception to several of the above mentioned theories? The answer is _resonance!</em> When electrons are delocalized, they are lower in energy, and the molecule is more stable. In order for electrons to be delocalized via resonance, they must be in a p orbital. Remember the four patterns of resonance? Each of those patterns involves pi electrons. An atom or molecule wants to reach the lowest energy state, so it will adopt the geometry and hybridization to achieve it.</p>
<p>The take home message: be on the lookout for those 4 patterns of resonance! If electrons on an atom are delocalized (involved in resonance), they will be in a p orbital. That means the atom must be $$sp^2&amp;&amp; or sp hybridized.</p>
