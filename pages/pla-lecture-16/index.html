<h1>Optical Activity</h1>
<p>We said that a enantiomers have the same chemical and physical properties.  Well then, how can we tell the difference between enantiomers?  What makes them unique (aside from smell and biological activity)?</p>
<p>The answer lies in optical activity.  <em>Please read sections 4.8 and 4.9 in the textbook.</em></p>
<p>Chiral compounds are <strong>optically active</strong>; they rotate plane-polarized light.  Achiral compounds are <strong>optically inactive</strong>; they do not rotate light.  Thus, saying something is optically active or not is the same as saying it is chiral or achiral.</p>
<p>Enantiomers rotate light in equal, but opposite directions.  One enantiomer will be the (+) enantiomer and the other will be (-).  (Note: There is no connection between +/- to R/S configuration.)  When a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is analyzed in a polarimeter, the specific rotation is 0.  They cancel each other out!  This type of mixture is known as <strong>racemic</strong>.</p>
