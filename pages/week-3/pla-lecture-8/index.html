<h1>Nomenclature of Alkenes</h1>

<p>Because the presence of a double bond significantly changes the reactivity of a compound, there is a need to classify them as a separate family.</p>

<p>From the last PLA, you are familiar with the structural features of C-C double and triple bonds. Now, it&#39;s time to learn how to name them.</p>

<p>The same basic rules we saw for alkanes will still apply. (Review the lecture notes and sections 3.2 and 3.3 in the textbook.)</p>

<p>For alkenes and alkynes, the double or triple bond will be given "priority." We will number the longest continuous change that contains the double (or triple) bond and the suffix will be "-ene" (or "-yne" for triple bonds).</p>

<p><em>The textbook has coverage and practice on this topic on pages 148-152 and 199-203.</em>  </p>
