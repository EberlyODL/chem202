<h1>Resonance</h1>

<h3>Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the <a href="/drawing-structures.md">third Foundations module</a> on drawing structures.</h3>

<p>Resonance will be an important consideration for us in the course.  We will first see resonance theory applied to acid-base chemistry.  </p>

<p>There are four basic patterns of resonance to watch for.  One of these patterns was seen in the foundational review. </p>

<p>There will be resonance when:</p>

<blockquote><p>1) lone pairs are adjacent to a double (or triple) bond
2) lone pairs or double bonds are adjacent to positive charge
3) a double (or triple) bond exists between two atoms of differing electronegativities
4) there are alternating double-single bonds in a closed ring (i.e. benzene)</p></blockquote>
