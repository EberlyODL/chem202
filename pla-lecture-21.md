# Alkene Stability

In the next class session we will begin to look at a class of organic reactions known as **elimination reactions**.  Elimination reactions involve the loss of H and a leaving group to form an alkene (see Figure 1 below).  (Note that this is the reverse of the addition reactions we have learned.)

Usually, the major product of the reaction is the more stable alkene.  Alkene stability is related to the substitution.  You have seen how we classify alcohols,  alkyl halides, and even carbocations as primary, secondary, and tertiary based on the number of alkyl substituents.  Similarly, alkenes can be classified by the total number of alkyl substituents attached to both carbons of the double bond.  Monosubstituted alkenes have one substituent on a carbon of the double bond.  Disubstituted have two groups, trisubstituted have three groups, and tetrasubstituted have four groups.

The stability of alkenes increases as the number of alkyl substituents increases. This conclusion is made by interpreting data collected from heats of hydrogenation. (See section 5.6 of the text for more details. However, know that we will not focus on how this data was obtained.)  The order of stability can be explained with **hyperconjugation**.  Sigma bonds next door to the double bond can donate electron density to the more electronegative $$sp^2$$ hybridized atom. (Recall the
