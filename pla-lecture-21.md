# Alkene Stability

In the next class session we will begin to look at a class of organic reactions known as elimination reactions.  Elimination reactions involve the loss of H and a leaving group to form an alkene (see Figure 1 below).

Usually, the major product of the reaction is the more stable alkene.  Alkene stability is related to the substitution.  You have seen how we classify alcohols,  alkyl halides, and even carbocations as primary, secondary, and tertiary based on the number of alkyl substituents.  Similarly, alkenes can be classified by the total number of alkyl substituents attached to both carbons of the double bond.  Monosubstituted alkenes have one substituent on a carbon of the double bond.  Disubstituted have two groups, trisubstituted have three groups, and tetrasubstituted have four groups.
