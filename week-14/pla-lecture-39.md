# Radicals and Stability


Look at that - we're going to talk about stability AGAIN!!!

Why???  Because stability explains A LOT of things in organic chemistry!  And organic chemistry is all around us (even IN us!!!).

Radicals are intermediates in chemical reaction like carbocations or carbanions.  They don't exist for a long time and they are highly reactive. Radicals, however, are neutral and have a single, unpaired electron 

Carbon radicals are classified in the same way as carbocations: primary, secondary, or tertiary.  When radicals are next to alkenes or benzene rings, they can also be termed allylic or benzyllic.

Carbon radicals have an unpaired electron giving them only 7 electrons, one shy of an octet.  **_Does this make them electron rich or electron poor?_**

Of course, they are electron poor (only have 7 but want 8 electrons).
