# Radical Reaction Mechanisms


Radical reaction mechanisms use "fish-hook" arrows to show the movement of single electrons. (Connect and reflect on drawing resonance from Monday's class.)

In reactions, there are three steps that take place: initiation, propagation, and termination.  Below are some characteristics of each step.  (For examples, please see page 487 in the text.)

**_initiation_** - Radicals are generated from neutral molecules.  These radicals are formed when bonds are broken by the addition of light or heat.  Typically, a radical initiator is used where there are weak bonds that can be broken relatively easily.  Peroxides are an example of a radical initiator because the O-O bond is weaker than most other bonds.

**_propagation_** - New radicals are formed from old radicals.  The propagation steps are when the real business of the reaction takes place.  The organic reactant is involved here and the product is formed.  The propagation steps are where the overall free energy of the reaction is determined.  

**_termination_** - two radicals combine to form neutral compounds.  Often, there are several possible termination steps in a given reaction.  Drawing one is sufficient for the mechanism on paper.  The concentration of radicals at any one time in the reaction is very low, so the odds of radicals finding other radicals are small until one reactant is consumed.
