# Nucleophilicity and Basicity

Nucleophilicity is complex.  However, we will focus on the relationship between nucleophilicity and basicity.

Bruice writes, "If the attacking atoms are the same size, stronger bases are better nucleophiles." (page 271)

It will be important for us to classify nucleophiles based on their basicity.  We will do this in the same way we have before:

Very weak bases (conjugate acid pKa < 0)
Weak bases (conjugate acid pKa between 0-11)
Strong bases (conjugate acid pKa > 11)

For example, F$$^-$$ would be classified as a weak base because it has a conjugate acid with a pKa of 3.2 (weak acid).
