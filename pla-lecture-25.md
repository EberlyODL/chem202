# Naming amines and thiols

We have reached a point where we need to consider the priority of different functional groups in the name. When multiple functional groups are present, what group will be the principle group and assigned higher priority?

| Group \(Highest--&gt;lowest\) | Suffix | As substituent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -OH, alcohol | -ol | -hydroxy- |
| -SH, thiol | -thiol | -mercapto- |
| -NH$$\_2$$, amine | -amine | -amino- |
| C=C, alkene | -ene | n/a |
| C$$\equiv$$C, alkyne | -yne | n/a |

Any other substituent \(ether, sulfide, halogen, or alkyl\) will have equivalent priority and if those are the only functional groups, they will end in "-ane."  We will add to this list as we encounter other functional groups.  This ranking order will be provided on the exam, but with the suffix and substituent names omitted.
