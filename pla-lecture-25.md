# Naming ethers and sulfides

We will be synthesizing new functional groups via substitution reactions in the first two class sessions this week.

The prelecture content will focus on naming these functional groups so you know the language in order to speak fluently throughout the rest of the course. We'll also be incorporating some review of reactions and mechanism to keep it fresh in your mind. If you struggle with this portion, please reach out!

Ethers and sulfides are named two different ways. One is according to a common nomenclature system or the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system. Both systems are used, so I provide an overview of both below.

Ethers contain a C-O-C arrangement while sulfides are the sulfur analogs with a C-S-C arrangement of atoms. The common system is quite simple. Name the two alkyl groups on either side followed by the name "ether" or "sulfide." The alkyl groups are listed alphabetically. In the case where the two alkyl groups are identical, the prefix "di-" is used in front of the name. Only use the common names when both alkyl groups are simple (e.g. ethyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, cyclohexyl, etc.). Examples are shown below:


In the IUPAC system, ethers and sulfides are named as substituents on the parent chain just like alkyl branches or halides. After you identify the longest continuous chain, name any ether substituents as "alkoxy." The number of carbons in the substituent identifies the specific name. For example, 1 carbon would be a methoxy group ($$ROCH_3$$). For sulfides, the general name is "alkylthio" group. A two carbon sulfide group ($$RSCH_2CH_3$$) would be "ethylthio."


A few examples are highlighted in the videos below. Head back to Canvas to test yourself with the question set!

# Naming amines and thiols

We have reached a point where we need to consider the priority of different functional groups in the name. When multiple functional groups are present, what group will be the principle group and assigned higher priority?

| Group \(Highest-->lowest\) | Suffix | As substituent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -OH, alcohol | -ol | -hydroxy- |
| -SH, thiol | -thiol | -mercapto- |
| -NH$$_2$$, amine | -amine | -amino- |
| C=C, alkene | -ene | n/a |
| C$$\equiv$$C, alkyne | -yne | n/a |

Any other substituent (ether, sulfide, halogen, or alkyl) will have equivalent priority and if those are the only functional groups, the name will end in "-ane."  We will add to this list as we encounter other functional groups.  This ranking order will be provided on the exam, but with the suffix and substituent names omitted.



Amines and thiols (along with ethers and sulfides) can be made from substitution reactions.  These groups are named much like their oxygen analogs, alcohols.  Amines can be characterized by the number of alkyl substituents bonded to the nitrogen.  If there is one alkyl group, it is a primary amine. When there are two or three, they are secondary or tertiary, respectively.  (Note that this is different than how we classify the substitution of alcohols or halides.)

To name an amine, you can use a common system when the alkyl groups are simple (i.e. alkylamine).  For example, ethylamine, ethylmethylpropylamine, and diethylamine.

According to the IUPAC system, amines will have the parent name ending in "-_amine_."  (The same way as alcohols!)  For secondary or tertiary amines, you must indicate the substituents on the nitrogen by placing "N" rather than a number in front of the substituent.

When the amino group is not he principle group, then it is named as an "-_amino_-" substituent as highlighted below.

Thiols are a class of smelly compounds.  A small amount of methylthiol is used to give natural gas its odor.  Thiols are responsible for the smell of coffee, skunk, and many other scents.  

Thiols will be named in a similar manner to alcohols and amines.  The IUPAC system uses the suffix, "-_thiol_."  If it is named as a substituent, then it is named as "-_mercapto_-."  This name comes from the word mercaptan, which is the former name for thiols because of their ability to form complexes with mercury and other metals.
