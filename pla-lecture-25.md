# Naming amines and thiols

We have reached a point where we need to consider the priority of different functional groups in the name. When multiple functional groups are present, what group will be the principle group and assigned higher priority?



| Group \(Highest--&gt;lowest\) | Suffix | As substituent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -OH, alcohol | -ol | -hydroxy- |
| -SH, thiol | -thiol | -mercapto- |
| -NH$$\_2$$, amine | -amine | -amino- |
| C=C, alkene | -ene | n/a |
| C$$\equiv$$C, alkyne | -yne | n/a |

Any other substituent \(ether, sulfide, halogen, or alkyl\) will have the same
