# Skeletal Structures


Now that you refreshed your memory with how to represent simple molecules using Lewis structures, let's review skeletal structure/bond-line drawing/zig-zag notation.  This is especially useful for more complicated molecules since writing out Lewis structures can laborious and time consuming. Similarly, the cluttered formalism used for Lewis structures can be difficult to interpret with a quick glance. In this lesson, we will learn about an alternative formalism that is commonly used for representing the structures of carbon-containing molecules.

Skeletal structures are a standardized formalism that is used as shorthand for representing the structures of molecules (see Figure 1). They can be drawn quickly, and they aren’t as crowded as Lewis structures. We’ll examine how to draw these structures from a Lewis structure in the video below.
