# Resonance

### Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the [third Foundations module](/drawing-structures.md) on drawing structures.

Resonance will be an important consideration for us in the course.  We will first see resonance theory applied to acid-base chemistry.  

There are four basic patterns of resonance to watch for.  One of these patterns was seen in the foundational review. 

There will be resonance when:
> 1) lone pairs are adjacent to a double (or triple) bond
> 2) lone pairs or double bonds are adjacent to positive charge
> 3) a double (or triple) bond exists between two atoms of differing electronegativities
> 4) there are alternating double-single bonds in a closed ring (i.e. benzene)

When two or more resonance structures exist, then it is necessary to evaluate their relative contribution to the hybrid.  When ranking resonance contributors, consider the following in order:
> 1) The octet is satisfied
> 2) Formal charge is minimized
> 3) Electronegative atoms have negative charge and electropositive atoms have positive charge.


If there is no way to differentiate the two structures, they are equivalent.
