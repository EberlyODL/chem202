# Alkene Addition Reactions


Get excited!!  Here is your first chance to apply the basic mechanistic principles we have been learning!  

Generally, alkenes react with strong acids to produce an addition product (Figure 1).  We will focus on products that are alkyl halides and alcohols.  Hydrogen adds to one carbon of the alkene and "X" (I, Br, Cl, or OH) adds to the other.  We will limit our discussion in this PLA to symmetric alkenes.  In symmetric alkenes, either way H and X add gives the same product.


Here is a specific example:



_Which reactant is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile?_ (Reflect on PLA16)
