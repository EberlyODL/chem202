# ARIO Rules

Without pKa at hand, we have to have a method for qualitatively assessing an acid's strength.  Various aspects of an acid's structure give us some information about acidity.  

The key idea is, _"It's all about the stability of the conjugate base!"_

There are four criteria to consider known as the ARIO rules.
## A = Atom


## R = Resonance


## I = Induction


## O = Orbital
