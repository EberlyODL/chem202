# Organic Foundations


There are 4 core content areas from general or introductory chemistry that are important foundations to determining the reactivity and properties of organic compounds.

1) Atomic Structure
    - Orbitals
    - Electron Configuration
    
    
2) Chemical Bonding
    - Intro to Bonding
    - Ionic Compounds
    - Covalent Compounds
    - Bond Polarity & Electronegativity
    - Valence Bond Theory
    
    
3) Drawing Structures
    - Formal Charge
    - Lewis Structure
    - Exceptions to the octet rule
    - Resonance
    
    
4) Molecular Shape
    - VSEPR Theory
    - Molecular Geometry
    - Molecular polarity


At the end of each content area, you will find a link to a canvas problem set.  You can attempt this problem set as many times as you like.  Only the highest score will be recorded.  Your score on these 4 practice sets will account for 20 points of your Foundations score.  The remaining 20 points will come from a 30-minute quiz on January 23 in class.
